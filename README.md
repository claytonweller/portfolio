## About Me

Hi! I’m Clayton Weller. I’m a smart coder, savvy business person, and a funny guy. I love using a variety of tools to solve problems. In undergrad I got a double major in Physics and Theater. I’ve been a CMO of an animation software company (Freak’n Genius - 2011-2013). I used tech startup methodology to create and run a comedy club/theater (Pocket Theater - ‘13-’17).

When it comes to technology. While I can cobble together a client facing application if I have to, I'm most interested in more backend-y work. I love, efficiently connecting together different data sources in interesting ways to solve tangible business problems.

When I’m not making cross-disciplinary businesses, I teach comedy writing workshops, go camping / backpacking, and play games (video, board, party... love them all!)
