## About Me

Hi! I'm Clayton Weller. I'm a smart coder, savvy business person, and a funny guy. I love
using a variety of tools to solve problems. On top of working as a
full-time web developer for over 5 years: I have a
double major in Physics and Theater, I was a founder of an animation
software company Freak'n Genius (2011-2013), and I used tech startup methodology to create and run a
comedy club/theater ('13-'17).

When it comes to technology, I love solving immediate, real business problems.
I personally identify as a backend developer with a focus on api
integrations, and scalability. But that doesn't mean that I can't cobble
together a client facing application if I have to. Mostly, I just derive great
joy from efficiently connecting together different data sources in interesting ways.

When I'm not making cross-disciplinary businesses, I teach comedy
writing workshops, go camping / backpacking, and play games (video,
board, party... love them all!)
