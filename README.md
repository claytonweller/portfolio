## About Me

Hi! I’m Clayton Weller. I’m a smart coder, savvy business person, and a funny guy. I love using a variety of tools to solve problems. In undergrad I got a double major in Physics and Theater. I’ve been a CMO of an animation software company (Freak’n Genius - 2011-2013). I used tech startup methodology to create and run a comedy club/theater (Pocket Theater - ‘13-’17).

When it comes to technology I’m most interested in using the power of programatic language to give users new verbs: using code to empower people to do new amazing things. Code is pretty much the magic of our time and I love being a mondern day techno wizard!

When I’m not making cross-disciplinary businesses, I teach comedy writing workshops, go camping / backpacking, and play games (video, board, party... love them all!)
