            Hi! I'm <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Clayton Weller</span>.
            I'm a smart coder, savvy business person, and a funny guy. On top of working as a
            full-time web developer for <b>over {yearsCoding} years</b>: I have a
            double major in Physics and Theater, was a founder of an animation
            software company (

          When it comes to technology, <b>I love solving immediate, real business problems.</b> 
          I personally identify as a full stack web developer with a lean toward the backend. 
          My focus has historically been on scalable microservices, integrations, APIs, and 
          data pipelines. Mostly, I just derive great joy from efficiently connecting together 
          different data sources in interesting ways. I have worked at both B2C and B2B companies 
          at scale, creating and maintaining infrastructure serving millions of users. 
          At previous employers Iâ€™ve been in charge of creating robust analytics pipelines, 
          managing sensitive financial data, and optimizing core search operations.

            When I'm not making cross-disciplinary businesses, I teach comedy
            writing workshops, go camping / backpacking, and play games (video,
            board, party... love them all!)
